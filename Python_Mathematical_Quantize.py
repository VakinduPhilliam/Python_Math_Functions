# Python Numeric and Mathematical Modules.
# numbers — Numeric abstract base classes.
# The numbers module (PEP 3141) defines a hierarchy of numeric abstract base classes which 
# progressively define more operations. None of the types defined in this module can be 
# instantiated.
# math — Mathematical functions.
# This module is always available. It provides access to the mathematical functions defined 
# by the C standard.
# cmath — Mathematical functions for complex numbers.
# This module is always available. It provides access to mathematical functions for complex numbers. 
# The functions in this module accept integers, floating-point numbers or complex numbers as arguments.
# decimal — Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic.
# The decimal module provides support for fast correctly-rounded decimal floating point arithmetic. 
# It offers several advantages over the float datatype:
# random — Generate pseudo-random numbers
# This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.
# statistics — Mathematical statistics functions.
# This module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric (Real-valued) data.
# In developing fixed-point applications, it is convenient to define functions to handle the quantize() 
# step:

def mul(x, y, fp=TWOPLACES):
        return (x * y).quantize(fp)

def div(x, y, fp=TWOPLACES):
        return (x / y).quantize(fp)
